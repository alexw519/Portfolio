        My name is Alexander Wilson. I am 24 years old and I am currently employed at Northwestern University. There, I am a telecom techninician. So I mostly deal with physically setting up the phone and internet connection throughout the campus. After I am done with this boot camp, I plan to look for a job developing software or websites. I graduated at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. There I recieved a bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in Japanese Language. Although, I always need to practice more as I am not fluent.

        I have many hobbies that I try to pursue. In terms of exercise, I like playing sports such as basketball and ultimate frisbee. For frisbee, I played on my college team every year. I also enjoy playing video games, watching tv, movies and anime. I like building collections of anything that I like so that whenever I want to look at something I enjoy, I can just walk to the other and view it. The hobby I want to pursue more is traveling as I have been to many states. And I have been out of the country once from when I went to Japan some years ago. I plan to visit there again possibly after I complete this bootcamp, and then travel to some European countries. The main one country besides Japan I want to  visit is Italy. I believe Venice is the city that is slowly going underwater and I would love to see it before it does so.
